Charity & Pet Care is built with the motivation of helping people & animals in need, these help include donation, emergency health advice & useful advice. 


During COVID-19 lockdown back in 2020, a lot of people & animals were in need of help. The impact of this lockdown is still present even if the intensity of it is quite diluted. Then there are also scenarios where helpless animals are suffering without proper food & treatment. One phone call or one search on the internet can definitely help these poor souls. 
 
Keeping this mindset, our team decided to develop a charity app which will bring people together to help others in need. This app provides options for donation based on categories & location, help post, experienced doctors for animals, nutritious foods for animals & option to connect with people all over the country.


We have used Java as the backend language for our app.  We have used Firebase realtime database to store and collect information from users. We used Google Map for map integrations.  We used Android Studio IDE to develop our app.


The app is currently in its basic version having only the bare minimum features. Weâ€™d like to improve the user interface to make it appealing to the users.
